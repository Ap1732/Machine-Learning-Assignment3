# Machine-Learning-Assignment3

introduction:

Open the discussion by explaining to the audience what decision trees are, and why they are important in machine learning.

Make it clear at the start of the decision tree why you want to build this for classifying scale.

Problem Statement:

Explain a business plan for opening a business that grows and sell wild mushrooms.

Point out the significance of identifying a mushroom as edible or toxic using the vegetable morphological traits.

Follow this by detailing what the data set is for this step.

Data Set Specifications:

The properties also of the dataset must be displayed such as the colours of cap, shape of stalk and solitary.

Demonstrate the steps taken to prepare and single-hot code the dataset for flexibility.

Decision Tree for Relaxation:

Introduce decision trees, discussing the steps involved, which are variously entailing entropy calculation, data partitioning, and information gain estimation.

Implementation issues: a. Entropy Computation (Activity 1).

Describe the compute_entropy() method and the way it calculates the entropy at the node.

Provide code excerpts and the corresponding output.

Split Data Set (Activity 2): As far as the differences can be shallow at times, the impact can be deep and consequential.

Explain the split_dataset() function including making it possible to split a dataset according to the variable which is chosen.

Present code samples and data set division graph to have a detailed description.

Activity 3

Talking about the compute_information_gain() function and how it is used to come up with the partition quality is the next.

Supply code samples, datasheets, and cost quotations for the different objects.

Activity 4

Discuss the role of get_best_split() function and its necessity for choosing the best split.

Show coding snippets and the partition that is targeting specific features.

Creating a Decision Tree:

Forge your way through constructing a decision tree by backward induction with the help of recursive partitioning.

For example, create a decision tree with nodes, branches, which lead to a leaf node.

Results and conclusions:

Choose the prime means of training and distributing the materials to the branch members as well as nodal members.

Describe that, a decision tree, is the right tool for the identification of the type of mushrooms to determine whether they are edible or not.

comes as the last step to conclude the usefulness of decision trees and the correctness of the studies.

Carrying this step-by-step instruction along with all annotations, legaleses and the diagrams, your medium post properly descriptive enough to learn how to create a decision tree step-by-step from understanding the process from scratch means that it can be promising for scale identification.
